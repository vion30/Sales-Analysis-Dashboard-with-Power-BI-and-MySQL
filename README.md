# Blinkit Sales Analysis with Power BI

## Overview

This project involves creating a comprehensive sales analysis dashboard using Power BI. The project highlights the process of importing data from a MySQL database and visualizing key metrics to aid business decision-making. The primary goal is to enable stakeholders to gain actionable insights into sales performance and trends.
## Key Features

* Database Integration: Imported a database (db_dump.sql) into MySQL to act as the data source.
* Power BI Dashboard: Developed interactive dashboards (SalesBI.pbix and SalesBi Final.pbix) to visualize sales metrics.
* Comprehensive Visualizations: Includes metrics like total revenue, product performance, regional sales analysis, and more.
* Dynamic Updates: The dashboard dynamically fetches and processes data from MySQL.
## Technology Used

* Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
* MySQL: As the backend database for data storage and querying.
* SQL: For data manipulation and querying within MySQL.
* CSV Files: Used for raw data imports and analysis.
